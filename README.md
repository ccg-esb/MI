# Modelling Evolutionary Fitness Landscapes of a Recombination Machine

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks exploring the regulatory and population dynamics of mobile integrons. The notebooks are organized sequentially, starting from the regulatory model and progressing to evolutionary simulations. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of mobile integron biology, combining theoretical models with computational simulations.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **MI_1_RegulatoryModel.ipynb**  
   This notebook introduces the regulatory model of mobile integrons, focusing on the mechanisms controlling cassette shuffling and expression dynamics. It provides a foundation for understanding how integrons contribute to bacterial adaptability.

2. **MI_2_RegulatoryModel_Data.ipynb**  
   This notebook extends the regulatory model by generating synthetic data representing cassette expression and shuffling dynamics. It provides a basis for parameter calibration and model validation.

3. **MI_3_PopulationModel_Parameters.ipynb**  
   This notebook defines key parameters for the population dynamics model, such as growth rates, resource utilization, antibiotic effects, and transition matrices. These parameters serve as inputs for the subsequent simulations.

4. **MI_4_PopulationModel_Competition.ipynb**  
   This notebook simulates competition between bacterial strains with varying integron configurations. It explores the impact of selective pressures, such as antibiotics, on strain dynamics and fitness outcomes.

5. **MI_5_PopulationModel_Paths.ipynb**  
   This notebook analyzes evolutionary paths through genotype space, quantifying accessibility and fitness landscapes. It uses graph-based approaches to evaluate how integron shuffling affects evolutionary trajectories.

6. **MI_6_PopulationModel_Evo.ipynb**  
   This notebook simulates long-term evolutionary dynamics in constant or periodic environments. It evaluates the effects of antibiotic treatments on population adaptation, highlighting the role of mobile integrons in driving diversity.

7. **MI_7_PopulationModel_FluctuatingEvo.ipynb**  
   This notebook investigates evolutionary dynamics under fluctuating selective pressures, such as oscillating antibiotic concentrations. It explores how environmental variability influences genotype stability and adaptive strategies.

These notebooks collectively provide a detailed computational exploration of mobile integrons, from regulatory mechanisms to population-level evolution in diverse environments.
